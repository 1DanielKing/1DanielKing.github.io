      <h3>About me!</h3>
      <p>
        I have been interested in technology since I was very young. It started
        with my use of the family PC running Windows 98 at age 5,
        messing with settings (sorry Dad) and exploring menus. Eventually I got
        into building PCs, and within in the last few years, 
        my interest has peaked as I see a potential career in something I 
        I began self studying Web Dev and Linux in 2022, and now I am currently attending
        a Full Stack Bootcamp at We Can Code IT, with a primary focus in Java.
